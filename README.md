# Node-Data-Processing
Chromatix Node Data Processing

To run this app:
1) Open command line in the outer most folder of the repo
2) Here run the command 'node .'

Please note I have not included the original node-data-processing-medium-data.csv file as it is too large to upload to git. I have instead included a smaller file.
When testing, please replace the node-data-processing-medium-data.csv file in this project with the original file.
